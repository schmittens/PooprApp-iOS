# PooprApp-iOS
xCode project for iOS app

This repository contains the work-in-progress code for the poopr iOS app component. 

So far, only very basic functionality is implemented:
- MapView
- User tracking
- Basic MapView settings

Rough to-do list:
- Add logic for creating new facilities
- Add logic for rating existing facilities
- Add logic for disputing facilities
- API access (depending on pooprAPI component of the project)
- Filtering options for API data
- Polish. Lots of polish.
